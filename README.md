# Versions, Collaborations and Sponsorships:
 About project versions: α (PRIVATE), β (PUBLIC) and γ (COMMERCIAL).

 Anyone can clone and contribute to the beta version.

 If you wish to support the development of this and other public projects, I will be immensely grateful!
 
 Your sponsorship helps me dedicate more time to developing new features, fixing bugs, and keeping everything up to date.
